The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use [RFC4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648) 
complient base64 encode and decode implentation in pure Swift. Further this implementation
tries to be faster than the [Foundation Base64](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata) 
implementation. 

Right now the implementation is dead simple. No fancy precomputed lookup tables, no fancy 
SIMD instructions. 

Everything began with [an issue](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/issues/1265) on [`swift-nio`](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio).

## Status

- [x] support for base64 and base64url 
- [x] faster than Foundation
- [ ] decoding can ignore line breaks
- [ ] encoding can insert line breaks
- [ ] 100% test coverage

## Performance

Super [simple performance test](https://github.com/fabianfett/swift-base64/blob/master/Sources/Base64PerformanceTest/main.swift) 
to ensure speediness of this implementation. Encoding and decoding 1m times the base64 string:

Quad Core 2,7 GHz Intel Core i7

|  | Encoding | Decoding |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Foundation   | 2.21s | 2.28s |
| swift-base64 | 1.01s | 1.06s |
| Speedup | 2.18x | 2.14x |

#### linux

|  | Encoding | Decoding |

| Foundation   | 33.64s | 3.49s |
| swift-base64 | 1.07s | 1.27s |
| Speedup | 31.18x | 2.74x |

I have no idea why Foundation base64 encoding is so slow on linux. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Literature for a faster algorithm

I would really like to speedup this repository further to be way faster than it is today.
Some food for thought of how this could be approached can be found here:

- [Chromium precomputed lookup tables](https://github.com/lemire/fastbase64/blob/master/src/chromiumbase64.c)
- [Wojciech Mu≈Ça, Daniel Lemire: Faster Base64 Encoding and Decoding using AVX2 Instructions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00605.pdf).
- [Daniel Lemire's blog - Ridiculously fast base64 encoding and decoding](https://lemire.me/blog/2018/01/17/ridiculously-fast-base64-encoding-and-decoding/)
- [Swift SIMD support](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0229-simd.md)

## Alternatives

As of today (2019-12-10) the author is only aware of two alternatives that both offer 
only encoding. Only one of those is a real library.
